# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System Implementation

## 🔐 Overview

The Next-Generation Quantum Computing Platform now includes a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that provides enterprise-grade security for multi-user scenarios while maintaining simplicity for single-user operation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Role Management System** (`quantum_platform/security/rbac.py`)
   - Hierarchical role system with permission inheritance
   - 5 default roles: Guest → Read-Only → Standard User → Developer → Admin
   - 28+ granular permissions for fine-grained control
   - Custom role creation and management

2. **User Management System** (`quantum_platform/security/user.py`)
   - User account creation and lifecycle management
   - Thread-local user context for session tracking
   - Authentication and session management
   - Permission checking and validation

3. **Security Enforcement** (`quantum_platform/security/enforcement.py`)
   - Decorators for function-level access control
   - Runtime permission and role checking
   - Security exceptions for unauthorized access
   - Integration with existing codebase

4. **Audit Logging** (`quantum_platform/security/audit.py`)
   - Comprehensive security event logging
   - File-based and in-memory audit storage
   - Compliance reporting and analytics
   - Security violation tracking

5. **Platform Integration** (`quantum_platform/security/integration.py`)
   - Seamless integration with quantum platform operations
   - Context managers for secure operations
   - Global security instance management
   - Operation-specific permission decorators

## 🎭 User Roles and Permissions

### Role Hierarchy

```
Admin (28 permissions)
├── Developer (22 permissions)
│   ├── Standard User (14 permissions)
│   │   ├── Read-Only (6 permissions)
│   │   │   └── Guest (3 permissions)
```

### Permission Categories

| Category | Examples | Guest | Read-Only | Standard | Developer | Admin |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Circuit Operations** | Create, Edit, Delete | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Simulation** | Run simulations | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Plugin Management** | Install, Remove | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Hardware Access** | Run on real devices | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **User Management** | Create, Delete users | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **System Admin** | Configure system | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Authentication

```python
from quantum_platform.security import initialize_security, SecurityContext

# Initialize security system
security = initialize_security()

# Create user session
with SecurityContext("alice", UserRole.STANDARD_USER.value):
    # User operations here
    pass
```

### Function-Level Security

```python
from quantum_platform.security import require_permission, require_role

@require_permission(Permission.INSTALL_PLUGIN)
def install_plugin(plugin_name: str):
    # Only users with INSTALL_PLUGIN permission can call this
    return f"Installing {plugin_name}"

@require_role(UserRole.ADMIN)
def admin_operation():
    # Only admin users can call this
    return "Admin operation completed"
```

### Quantum Platform Integration

```python
from quantum_platform.security.integration import require_circuit_permission

@require_circuit_permission("create")
def create_quantum_circuit(name: str):
    # Only users with circuit creation permission can call this
    with QuantumProgram(name=name) as qp:
        # Circuit creation code
        pass
```

## 📊 Security Features

### Audit Logging
- **Event Types**: Authentication, authorization, user management, system operations
- **Storage**: File-based logs with JSON format
- **Querying**: Filter by user, event type, time range
- **Compliance**: Security summaries and violation tracking

### Security Enforcement
- **Decorators**: `@require_permission`, `@require_role`, `@require_authentication`
- **Runtime Checks**: Dynamic permission validation
- **Context Management**: Secure operation contexts
- **Exception Handling**: Clear security error messages

### Multi-User Scenarios
- **Educational**: Professor/TA/Student role separation
- **Enterprise**: Admin/Developer/User hierarchies
- **Research**: Custom researcher roles with specific permissions
- **Public Demo**: Guest access with minimal permissions

## 🔧 Configuration and Management

### Default Setup
```python
# Single-user mode (default)
security = initialize_security()
# Automatically creates admin user and authenticates
```

### Multi-User Setup
```python
# Create different user types
with AdminContext():
    security.create_user_session("professor", UserRole.ADMIN.value)
    security.create_user_session("student1", UserRole.STANDARD_USER.value)
    security.create_user_session("guest", UserRole.READ_ONLY.value)
```

### Custom Roles
```python
# Create specialized roles
role_manager.create_role(
    name="quantum_researcher",
    description="Research scientist with hardware access",
    permissions={
        Permission.CREATE_CIRCUIT,
        Permission.RUN_SIMULATION,
        Permission.RUN_HARDWARE
    },
    inherits_from=UserRole.STANDARD_USER.value
)
```

## 📈 Security Monitoring

### Audit Dashboard
```python
# Get security summary
summary = security.get_security_summary()
print(f"Active users: {summary['user_system']['active_users']}")
print(f"Recent events: {summary['audit_summary']['total_events']}")
print(f"Permission denials: {summary['audit_summary']['permission_denials']}")
```

### Event Querying
```python
# Query specific events
auth_events = audit_logger.query_events(
    event_type=AuditEventType.USER_LOGIN,
    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24)
)
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Enforcement Points
1. **Circuit Operations**: Create, edit, delete, export quantum circuits
2. **Simulation Access**: Run simulations with resource limits
3. **Plugin Management**: Install, remove, configure plugins
4. **Hardware Operations**: Access to real quantum devices
5. **System Administration**: User management, system configuration

### Thread Safety
- All components are thread-safe with proper locking
- Thread-local user contexts prevent cross-contamination
- Concurrent user sessions supported

### Audit Compliance
- All security-relevant events are logged
- Tamper-evident audit trails

## 🎯 Conclusion

The RBAC system transforms the quantum computing platform from a single-user development environment into a production-ready, multi-user system suitable for:

- **Educational institutions** with professors and students
- **Research organizations** with different access levels
- **Enterprise environments** with role-based access
- **Public demonstrations** with guest access

The implementation provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining the platform's ease of use and extensibility. All existing quantum platform features continue to work seamlessly, with security enforcement happening transparently through decorators and context management.

The system is ready for immediate use in single-user mode (with admin privileges) and can be easily extended to support complex multi-user scenarios as requirements evolve.
