# Next-Generation Quantum Computing Platform

A comprehensive, local-first quantum computing development environment that seamlessly integrates quantum program development, simulation, and execution on real hardware within a single extensible system.

## Overview

This platform provides a unified development environment for quantum software developers, from writing quantum code and designing circuits to debugging, simulation, and running on real quantum processors. The system emphasizes local deployment, extensibility, and a modular architecture.

## Key Features

### Compiler and Intermediate Representation (IR)
- **High-Level Quantum Programming Language**: Python-based DSL for intuitive quantum program development
- **Robust IR**: Internal representation supporting complex quantum circuits and classical control flow
- **Extensible Gate Set**: Flexible gate definitions with support for custom gates
- **Optimization Passes**: Comprehensive circuit optimization including gate cancellation and parallelization
- **Qubit Management**: Intelligent allocation and lifetime management of quantum resources
- **Classical Control Flow**: Support for conditionals and loops in quantum programs
- **External Compatibility**: Import/export support for OpenQASM and other standard formats

### Architecture Principles
- **Local-First**: Runs on localhost without containers, works offline
- **Modular & Extensible**: Each subsystem can be upgraded independently
- **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive for beginners, powerful for experts
- **Production-Ready**: Real hardware integration with proper security/compliance

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantum-platform/quantum-platform.git
cd quantum-platform
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from quantum_platform.compiler.language import QuantumProgram
from quantum_platform.compiler.gates import H, CNOT, X
from quantum_platform.compiler.language import measure

# Create a Bell state circuit
with QuantumProgram() as qp:
    q = qp.allocate(2)         # allocate 2 qubits
    H(q[0])                    # apply Hadamard on qubit 0
    CNOT(q[0], q[1])           # controlled NOT on qubit0->qubit1
    m = measure(q)             # measure both qubits
    if m == "11":              # classical control flow based on measurement
        X(q[0])                # apply X if both measured 1

# Export to OpenQASM
qasm_code = qp.circuit.to_qasm()
print(qasm_code)
```

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
